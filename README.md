# InternPrep
This is my attempt at documenting my daily progress in my preparation for the internship season in August of 2023.
I plan to write on this README file every day/week/whenever I get time, will be adding links to tuts I follow, things I learnt etc.

I have opted to take up a course in Data Structures and Algorithms in my upcoming semester.
It will be using Java thus I decided to brush up some of the Java I had learnt in my school days.

I referred to online tutorials to refresh syntax on Java and learnt concepts like OOP in Java and wrote a few simple programs to implement what I learnt.
I got started with a data structures and algorithms playlist on youtube as well.

I have given 3 Competitive Programming contests in the last 10 days and am now rated 825 on Codeforces.
I am thoroughly enjoying these contests and having a lot of fun solving questions from the problemsets, it can be very frustrating at times too but when the solution clicks it just feels very satisfying. 
I have so far given my contests in Python 3, however, I have started to attempt practice problems in C++. 
I am also trying to balance this with the DSA lectures playlist, the latter I feel is becoming a little hard to tackle without much guidance from others.

The "year" is coming to an end and I'm really proud of my progress these past 2 weeks! Not waiting for the new year to start writing a new chapter in my journey is probably one of the best decisions I have made. I crossed 1000 on codeforces and am doing my best to solve a problem a day. The C++ switch makes it all a little harder but it's probably for the better. Cheers to 2023!
