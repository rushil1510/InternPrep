# InternPrep
This is my attempt at documenting my daily progress in my preparation for the internship season in August of 2023.
I plan to write on this README file every day/week/whenever I get time, will be adding links to tuts I follow, things I learnt etc.

I have opted to take up a course in Data Structures and Algorithms in my upcoming semester.
It will be using Java thus I decided to brush up some of the Java I had learnt in my school days.

## 18/12/2022
I referred to online tutorials to refresh syntax on Java and learnt concepts like OOP in Java and wrote a few simple programs to implement what I learnt.
I got started with a data structures and algorithms playlist on youtube as well.
